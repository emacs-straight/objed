= Changes

== 0.8.0 (2019-03-24)

* Add prefix key for custom user commands using objed-user-map
* The active object is buffer local and reinitilized when switching buffers
* Activate on switch-buffer and find-file
* Change default bindings most notably f/b move by sexp and not by character
  C-f, C-b exit objed
* New commands: raise, reformat, append-mode, eval-context, shrink-context
* Rewrite replacement command
* Improve identifier movement and replacement
* New Objects: mail, page, url, ace-object (by line)
* Improve object expansion and expand object (visual selection)
* Lots of little fixes and improvements

== 0.4.0 (2019-01-27)

* Adjust more default bindings to be more emacsy. Most important changes are:

  Don't just insert pairs using (/[/{. Those keys should be mapped to commands
  and surrounding objects is done via kbd:['].

  Use kbd:[t] to toggle the object state and kbd:[h] to expand line objects
  (analog to Emacs kbd:[M-h]). kbd:[l] gives direct access to line-object now.

  Moving between objects of current object type is done using kbd:[[] and
  kbd:[\]]. kbd:[<] and kbd:[>] move to first/last instance of current object
  type. kbd:[(] and kbd:[)] are used for objed-forward/backward-until.

  Use kbd:[S-left/S-right] to move current object type around.
